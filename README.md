## 📌 Overview

MindFit uses machine learning to predict mental health conditions based on lifestyle, behavioral, and clinical factors. It features a **dual-model ensemble** (Random Forest + MLP Neural Network) for more reliable predictions, along with a built-in **honesty/consistency detector**.

### Key Features

- **🏠 Dashboard** — Interactive data exploration with condition distribution visualizations
- **📝 Smart Assessment** — Sectioned questionnaire covering demographics, lifestyle, mood, social life, and clinical history
- **🕵️ Honesty Detection** — AI-powered consistency analysis that flags contradictory responses
- **🔮 Dual-Model Prediction** — Random Forest (ML) + MLP Neural Network (DL) ensemble predictions
- **📅 History Tracking** — Save and track assessment results over time per user
- **📊 Data Explorer** — Deep dive into the dataset with interactive charts
- **📈 Model Insights** — Feature importance, model performance metrics, and comparisons

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShovanKanjilal/Mindfit-Mental-Health-Prediction-System-using-ML-and-DL.git
   cd Mindfit-Mental-Health-Prediction-System-using-ML-and-DL
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the models** (optional — pre-trained models are included)
   ```bash
   python model_training.py   # Train Random Forest
   python mlp_training.py     # Train MLP Neural Network
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`
